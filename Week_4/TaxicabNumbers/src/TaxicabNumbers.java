/**
 * Problem statement: Taxicab numbers.
 * A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes of integers in two different ways:
 * a3+b3=c3+d3.
 * For example, 1729=93+103=13+123.
 * Design an algorithm to find all taxicab numbers with a, b, c, and d less than n.
 * <p>
 * Version 1: Use time proportional to n2logn and space proportional to n2.
 * Version 2: Use time proportional to n2logn and space proportional to n.
