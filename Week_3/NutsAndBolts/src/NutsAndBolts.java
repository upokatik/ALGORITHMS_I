/**
 * Problem statement: Nuts and bolts.
 * A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile of n nuts and n bolts.
 * The goal is to find the corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts.
 * Each nut fits exactly one bolt and each bolt fits exactly one nut.
 * By fitting a nut and a bolt together, the carpenter can see which one is bigger (but the carpenter cannot compare
 * two nuts or two bolts directly). Design an algorithm for the problem that uses nlogn compares (probabilistically).
